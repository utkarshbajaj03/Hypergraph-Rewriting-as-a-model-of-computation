# Hypergraph-Rewriting-as-a-model-of-computation

This project started in WSS 2022. I compile different models of computation (Turing machines, Register Machines, programming languages) into hypergraph rewriting. 

Future stuff: formalise what computability means on hypergraphs, and quantum computing. Note that quantum parallelism can show up here...I definitely think so. We can study typed concurrent programming. Also, I'd like to get an opinion from the some of the experts in my university.
